Ready to feel like a tech superhero? Let‚Äôs dive in !

## How to Access the Jarvis UI

Getting started is a breeze! Follow these steps to launch the UI:

1. **Clone the Repository**\
   Grab the code from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Jarvis-AI-UI.git
   cd Jarvis-AI-UI
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Environment**

   - Ensure you have Python 3.6+ and Microsoft Edge installed.
   - No `.env` file is needed yet (based on current files).

3. **Install Dependencies**\
   Run this to get the required Python package:

   ```bash
   pip install eel
   ```

4. **Launch the UI**\
   Start the interface with:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   - This opens Microsoft Edge with the UI at `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.
   - A futuristic window with a black background, glowing buttons, and animations will appear.

5. **Interact**

   - Click the mic button to start voice input (currently logs to console‚Äîmore functionality may come later).
   - Type in the input field or use the chat/settings buttons to explore.

**Pro Tip**: Keep Edge updated and your internet on for smooth performance!

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

Hit a snag? Here‚Äôs how to spot and fix common issues:

### 1. **UI Doesn‚Äôt Open**

- **Signs**: Running `python main.py` shows errors like ‚ÄúModuleNotFoundError‚Äù or no window appears.
- **Fix**:
  - Install Eel: `pip install eel`.
  - Check Python version: Run `python --version` (needs 3.6+).
  - Ensure `www` folder with `index.html` exists.
  - Look at terminal errors for clues.

### 2. **Mic Button Doesn‚Äôt Respond**

- **Signs**: Clicking the mic button logs ‚ÄúMicrophone button clicked!‚Äù but no audio input works.
- **Fix**:
  - Microphone may not be enabled‚Äîtest it in another app (e.g., Edge).
  - Check if additional features are missing (pending future updates).
  - Ensure Edge has microphone permissions.

### 3. **Animations or Layout Look Weird**

- **Signs**: Particles don‚Äôt move, or the interface is misaligned.
- **Fix**:
  - Resize your window‚Äîrun `resizeCanvas()` manually in browser console if needed.
  - Update your browser (Edge) to the latest version.
  - Check internet connection for CDN files (e.g., Bootstrap, Font Awesome).

### 4. **Page Loads but Stays Blank**

- **Signs**: White or black screen with no content.
- **Fix**:
  - Verify `www/index.html` and `www/script.js` are in place.
  - Clear browser cache or try a different browser (e.g., Chrome).
  - Check console (F12 in Edge) for JavaScript errors.

### 5. **App Crashes**

- **Signs**: Script stops or Edge closes unexpectedly.
- **Fix**:
  - Ensure `main.py` runs without port conflicts (change `port=8000` if needed).
  - Check terminal for errors (e.g., file not found).
  - Update Edge or reinstall Eel.

**Still Stuck?** Drop a note in GitHub issues with your error message!

## üìã Requirements

To run Jarvis AI UI smoothly, you‚Äôll need:

## üíª Virtual Environment Tips

Keep your project neat with a virtual environment! Here‚Äôs how:

- **Create a Virtual Env**:

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  ```

- **Activate It**:

  - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
  - Mac/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

- **Install Dependencies Inside**:

  ```bash
  pip install eel
  ```
